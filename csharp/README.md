# DRES Example Client: C#

Back to the [DRES Example Clients](../README.md)

In this project, there is example code on how to use the DRES Client library for c#.

The main example code is in the [Client.cs](src/Client.cs) file.

## Setup

Please run
```
./gradlew buildOpenApi
```

to get the client side bindings.

Alternatively, to just get the generated bindings,
you can also run the `openapiGenerate` gradle task.
