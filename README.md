# DRES Client Examples

This is a service repository with examples on how to use the 
[Official DRES Client OAS](https://github.com/dres-dev/DRES/blob/master/doc/oas-client.json)
to create participating clients for [DRES](https://github.com/dres-dev/DRES/).

Currently, there are examples in these languages:

* [Java](java/README.md)
* [Kotlin](kotlin/README.md)
* [c#](csharp/README.md)
* [typescript/ angular](angular-ts/README.md)

## Prerequisites

To have the examples somewhat aligned, we rely on the great
[Gradle OpenAPI Generator Plugin](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/tree/master/modules/openapi-generator-gradle-plugin)
and thus, on [Gradle](https://gradle.org) - however, as we use the gradle wrapper, you shouldn't notice this.

Besides that, the examples are in various languages with their own set of prerequisites.

## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome. Feel free to add the example in your preferred language and create a PR for it.
